# ✨ TalentLink

> A peer-to-peer skill-sharing platform for students to connect, learn, and grow together.  
> Built as part of a Systems Analysis & Design project at **Kent State University** 🎓

## 🌸 Overview
**TalentLink** is a conceptual mobile app designed to help students exchange skills with their peers.  
Users can create profiles, list talents they can *teach* or *learn*, and get matched with others based on shared interests — simplifying collaboration and promoting community learning.  

---

## 💡 Purpose
Right now, students rely on word-of-mouth or paid tutoring to find someone with a specific skill.  
**TalentLink** streamlines that by showing *who knows what* — and who’s willing to teach it — all in one place.
